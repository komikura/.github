A next-generation unified comic reading platform built with passion by comic enthusiasts. We, KomiKura aims to provide the best reading experience for manga, manhwa, manhua, and other image-based comics.

## Our Mission

After the unfortunate shutdown of [comick.io](https://comick.io) as a central hub for reading, we recognized the need for a reliable, modern platform where comic lovers can enjoy their favorite stories without interruptions. KomiKura is being built from the ground up with stability, performance, and user experience as our top priorities.

## Planned Features

- **Extensive Collection**: A large, varied selection of stories and illustrations from different genres and languages.
- **Personalized Reading Experience**: Customizable reading settings and bookmarking.
- **Multi-format Support**: Seamless support for manga, manhwa, manhua, and more.
- **Cross-platform Compatibility**: Responsive design that works on desktop and mobile and much more!
- **Community Driven**: Regular updates based on user feedback and contributions.
